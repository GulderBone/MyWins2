# MyWins2
Better version of MyWins app. I'm still in the process of developing it.
  
  This new version will include things like:
    
    -MVP pattern  
    -Repository pattern  
    -Better animations  
    -Sliding views with ViewPager  
    -More Fragments  
    -RxJava2  
    -Testing with Mockito  
    -Better design  
    -Better UX
      
      Master branch contains latest tested version. Test branch contains my the most up-to-date changes.
      But it won't always compile. ;D I think I have to create third branch.
        
      This repository is strongly connected with https://github.com/jcup1/MVPLearn5
          
      MVPLearn5 is my latest repository that I use to learn new things. Starting with MVP pattern.
