This is the refactored version of MyWins app
## About MyWins
MyWins allows you to keep your achievements in one place. Achievements are editable and contain title, description, date, importance, category, and photos. 

It helps you stay motivated and remember about your abilities in tough times. Also, in case you are a very successful person, you can sort successes in many ways lol.
