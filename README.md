This is the refactored version of MyWins app
## About MyWins
MyWins allows you to keep the list of your life achievements in one eye-friendly place. Achievements are editable and can contain title, description, date, importance, category, and photos. 

It's a simple way to stay motivated. In case you are a very successful person, you can sort successes in many ways. Although I don't recommend adding too much of them because of the risk of being critically overwhelmed.

PS: I don't take responsibility for your potential suffering from success.

## History
This was my first "bigger" app and for sure it's not a gold standard. Alternatively, I find time to improve something once a week. I do not intend to grow it crazily. But it remains as a example of not being afraid of new arenas as I started it with almost no knowledge at all.

Now I'm in process of refactoring it. Special thanks to [MrOnyszko](https://github.com/mronyszko) for great Android mentoring as he is the author of some profound concepts that I implemented durning the code refactoring. 

## For nerds

    -Kotlin language
