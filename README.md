# MyWins2
This is the refactored version of MyWins app
## About MyWins
MyWins allows you to keep the list of your life achievements in one eye-friendly place. All of them are are editable and contain title, description, date, importance, category and photos. It's a simple way to stay motivated. In case you are a very successful person, you can sort successes in many ways. Although I don't recommend adding too much of them because of risk of being critically overwhelmed. 

PS: I don't take responsibility for your potential suffering from success.

## History
This was my first "bigger" app and for sure it's not a gold standard. Alternatively, I find time to improve something once a week. I do not intend to grow it crazily. But it remains as a example of not being afraid of new arenas as I started it with almost no knowledge at all.

## For nerds
This app includes things like:

    -Kotlin language
    -MVP architecture
    -Repository pattern
    -Room
    -ViewPager
    -Fragments
    -RxJava2
    -Mockito  
    -Figma design
