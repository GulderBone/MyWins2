# MyWins2
Better version of MyWins app. I'm still in the process of developing it.
  
  This new version will include things like:
    
    -MVP pattern  
    -Repository pattern  
    -Better animations  
    -Sliding views with ViewPager  
    -More Fragments  
    -RxJava2  
    -Testing with Mockito  
    -Better design  
    -Better UX
      
      Master branch contains latest tested version. Test branch contains my the most up-to-date changes.
      But it won't always compile. ;D I think I have to create third branch.
        
      This repository is strongly connected with https://github.com/jcup1/MVPLearn5
          
      MVPLearn5 is my latest repository that I use to learn new things. Starting with MVP pattern.  
        
//13.11.17 New version of this app has some issues but it works and is refactored. Again in main branch.  
//14.11.17 There is a problem with leaking sqlite. It's not the hardest bug to fix but I want to do it better. It's a good opportunity to learn Room library. I should fix everything today and put it on google play.
//24.11.17 I have privacy policy issue because of camera usage. I will try to fix it but for now there is no latest 1,5 version  on google play.
